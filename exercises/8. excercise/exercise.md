## Excercise

1. Create a mutation to add a product.
   The mutation is not secured behind authentication for now. For now just attach always the same creator automatically.
   The mutation should accept the name, description & image url.

2. Design the mutation(s) to update the name, description, image url and creator of a product.

Bonus: Implement these mutation(s).
